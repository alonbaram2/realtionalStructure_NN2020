Functional example data sets in SUIT space

HCP*.nii contain the group T-values for 100 subjects from the human connectome data set, which have been morphed slightly from the FSL space into SUIT space. 
The tasks and contrasts are described in detail in: 

Barch DM, Burgess GC, Harms MP, Petersen SE, Schlaggar BL, Corbetta M, Glasser MF, Curtiss S, Dixit S, Feldt C, Nolan D, Bryant E, Hartley T, Footer O, Bjork JM, Poldrack R, Smith S, Johansen-Berg H, Snyder AZ, Van Essen DC (2013) Function in the human connectome: task-fMRI and individual differences in behavior. Neuroimage 80:169-189.

Wiestler_2011_motor_z.nii are the z-value of average classification for the movement of individual fingers, which can be used as a functional localiser for the two cerebellar hand areas. For details see:
