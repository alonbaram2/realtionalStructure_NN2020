Probabilistic Cerebellar Atlas in SUIT space for use with MRIcron. 
 http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/

Use this probabilistic Atlas only with imaging data aligned to SUIT space (Diedrichsen, 2006).

While SUIT is spatially unbiased in relationship to MNI space (thus is in MNI coordinates!), 
the alignment is better with SUIT than with any other tested whole brain alignment method. 
For data aligned with whole brain normalization methods, use the Cerebellar Atlas in MNI space after 
affine or non-linear alignment.
